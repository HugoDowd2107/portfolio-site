Initially there was more appointment fields including “practitioner role” and “consult type”. The information architecture of including these fields was difficult as they are inter-related and it was found that practitioners and appointment types would cover everything necessary. The decision was also made that no restrictions would be placed on practitioners and appointment types. If a practitioner didn’t have a certain appointment type it would still be valid. This would be covered when the appointment is created.</div>
